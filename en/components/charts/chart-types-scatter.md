# Angular Scatter Chart

Angular Scatter Chart is a group of series that show markers to represent the relationship among items in several distinct series of data or to plot data items using x and y coordinates. The x and y coordinates of the data point are determined by two numeric data columns. The Scatter Series draw attention to uneven intervals or clusters of data. These types of series are often used to plot scientific data, and can highlight the deviation of collected data from predicted results. Scatter series can also be used to organize data chronologically (even if the data is not in chronological order).

## Angular Scatter Chart Example

<!-- TODO use this iframe which will point to a new sample:
<iframe src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-type-scatter-series' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Scatter Chart Example"></iframe> -->

## Angular Scatter Marker Chart

Scatter Chart draws attention to uneven intervals or clusters of data and highlight the deviation of collected data from predicted results that are often used to plot scientific and statistical data. In addition to these characteristics of Scatter Chart, the sizes of Point Chart markers (points) in are data-driven. The following sections list important conceptual and task-based information on how to use the Point Chart and its features.

In this example, the Scatter Point Chart is comparing the total births and deaths between Africa and Europe in 2015.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-scatter-point-chart' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Scatter Marker Chart"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Angular Scatter Bubble Chart

The Bubble Chart contains many of the characteristics of the Scatter Point Chart but with the option to have various radius scale sizes.

In this example, the Scatter Bubble Chart is comparing the total births and deaths between Africa and Europe in 2015.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-scatter-bubble-chart-multiple-sources' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Scatter Bubble Chart"></iframe>
</div>
