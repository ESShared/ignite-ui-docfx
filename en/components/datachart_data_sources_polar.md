            { Direction: 0,   WindSpeed: 70,  BoatSpeed: 90 },
            { Direction: 45,  WindSpeed: 35,  BoatSpeed: 65 },
            { Direction: 90,  WindSpeed: 25,  BoatSpeed: 45 },
            { Direction: 135, WindSpeed: 15,  BoatSpeed: 25 },
            { Direction: 180, WindSpeed:  0,  BoatSpeed: 0  },
